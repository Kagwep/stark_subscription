# stark_subscription

This project allows users to subscribe to channels on a decentralized network. Users can pay a subscription fee, 
typically using cryptocurrency, to access exclusive content or services provided by channel creators. Cairo is used 
for creating smart contracts and StarkNet provides the infrastructure for running these contracts efficiently on a Layer 2 blockchain. 
This ensures secure and scalable subscription management, enabling channel creators to offer their content or services while users enjoy a seamless and 
decentralized subscription experience.
